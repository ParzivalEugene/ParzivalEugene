# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eugene and I am a young developer from Russia. I am interested in promoting open source projects and improving my programming skills. I can confidently say that I know Python and can work with many libraries. I also know SQL and can use a DBMS in tandem with Python. Of course, I know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. At the moment I am working on my discord bot - Samurai.

### Actual project - [Samurai](https://github.com/ParzivalEugene/Samurai)

An incredible discord bot named Samurai. It is simply irreplaceable on any server. A samurai can create a level system, moderate participants, wish them a happy birthday. Also, a samurai can play simple games (tic-tac-toe and connect four) with different tactics. It can play songs from YouTube, create queues and playlists. Reacts amazingly accurately to appeals to him and will always keep up the conversation.

### My company - [INVINCIBLE WARRIORS](https://github.com/invincible-warriors)

I created this company to bring together truly interested people who are able to solve unusual problems and create incredible projects.
