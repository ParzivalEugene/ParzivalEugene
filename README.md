# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eugene and I am a young developer from Russia. I am interested in promoting open source projects and improving my programming skills. I can confidently say that I know Python and can work with many libraries. I also know SQL and can use a DBMS in tandem with Python. Of course, I know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. At the moment I am working on my discord bot - Samurai.
